# Secret Santa Matcher

Generate matches for Secret Santa.

1. Type your list of participants
2. Add exclusions in brackets eg. Bob (Jane) - Bob won't match with Jane
3. Generates a list of matches, with the receiver encoded as a base64 string. Not the most secure format but enough to obfuscate the name for a casual game
4. Provides a link to each participant where they can reveal their match but decoding the base64 string.
